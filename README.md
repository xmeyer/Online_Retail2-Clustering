# Online_Retail2-Clustering

**Purpose:**
To help this online retail store save money on ads by focusing on a group of customers that are most interested in the company.

**Desiring to practice clustering models, these are some steps that I've taken along the way:**
> * Pandas merge to create a dataframe from 2009-2011, the reimplemented merge with groupby to get a new dataframe that is focused on relation with each customer (grouped by Customer ID)
> * Performed outlier analysis and removal with IQR (boxplots and scatterplots for visualization)
> * Multiple clustering techniques, due to their specific strengths and weaknesses

**Resources:**
Many articles, kaggle submissions, and youtube videos (of course stackoverflow).

**Libraries:**
> NumPy
> Pandas
> Matplotlib
> Seaborn
> Scikit-Learn
> SciPy
